-- getpagelink needs to
	- always return https://
	- know what domain is required for each page (each template)
		-- to be easier, should we change templates so the domain is a select, not a checkbox list
		-- each template would have only one domain
		-- a domain might have many templates (a forward type)
		
		
	-- pagemanagercontroller, line 1711 -- I think httpcontext should hold if request is secure, not core.webServer.requestSecure


weave organiztionid fields should always be set readonly or writeonce.

time
	- server and sql server always on UTC
	- change to sync with time.nist.gov
	- users have timezoneid for translating times in view.
	- timezone table that holds a 'key' that can be used by the system (or external call) to generate current time
	- ? ms or international timezones ?

enhanded logging
	- setup nlog to log to cloudwatch
	- verify login, logout logging
	- we need an alert on logging failure
	- (cloudwatch?) need an automated system that reviews logs and alerts us that something is unusual
	- (cloudwatch?) need a tool that generates reports (or filters so we can find things)
	

upgraded passwords
	- turn on/off with site property 'allow plain text password'
		if true
			- password is read and written to field 'password'
			- admin password save calls method setPassword (in after-save) which creates one-way hash saved in passwordHash
		if false
			- admin password save calls method setPassword (in after-save) which creates one-way hash saved in passwordHash
			- login attempts are checked agains passwordHash
			- if a login attempt is made and passwordHash is blank and password is not blank, the password field is hashed, saved to passwordHash, and password is cleared
	- need new cp.user method to setPassword() -- saves to passwordHash and password (if allow plain text is true)
	- password policy is enforced in setPassword() from a password-policy json saved in a site property
		- min number of characters
		- req upper/lower, special, numerics
		- 
		
session enhandements
	- account is locked for 30 minutes if 3 failed attempts in 15 minutes on a username
	- only allow 2 active sessions per user. If a new one starts, the first is logged out
	- verify session terminates after 60 minutes of inactivity



Convert config to support different S3 buckets for public, private, www.
	- leave config.json alone - no change to serverconfig and appconfig models
	- serverconfig 
		- awsBucketName should be used as the default bucketname
	- appConfig
		- remoteWwwPath, remoteFilePath, remotePrivatePage
			- begin with "/", use the serverconfig bucketname
			- begin with "S3://" this is an s3 resource and use is just as it is included
