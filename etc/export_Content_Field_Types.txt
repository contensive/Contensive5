*note: all field types also have an optional 
	- readonly
	- required

To see how the field in the admin site are setup, edit any record and click the button in the upper-right [Modify Form]. That shows the field type for each field.

integer
	integer
text
	text up to 255 characters
longtext
	text infinitely long
boolean
	editor is a checkbox
date
	a date and a time component. This is tricky. To see what I have done, edit a person and in permissions see the password expiration field.
file
	an upload file. The trick here is to upload the file, the user adds a file, but a blank entry should not delete the file (like lext would do). 
	See what I did in admin, this is what people have needed over the years, a link so they can download it, and a checkbox so they can delete. 
lookup
	a select list with currentValue, htmlName, htmlValue and htmlCaption.
redirect
	you can ignore this type for now
currency
	a float number displayed as currency
textfile 
	treat the same as longtext
image
	a file upload, but display the image if it has been uploaded, and add a delete checkbox
float
	a number with decimal points
autoincrement
	same as an integer, but will always be read only
manytomany
	this results in a checkbox list. 
member select
	a select just like lookup
css file
	a long text field that will always have css data
xml file
	a long text field that will always have xml data
javascript file
	a long text field that will always have javascript data
link
	a 255 character text field that will be a link. The user should be able edit it, or click it to see what it does 
resource link
	same as link
html
	a wysiwyg editor
html file
	same as html field
html code
	a text editor and the content will be html code
