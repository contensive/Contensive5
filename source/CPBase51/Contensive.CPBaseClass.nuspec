	<summary>The CPBaseClass is the required reference to create Contensive Add-ons that use Dot Net code.</summary>
    <description>The CPBaseClass package includes a reference to CPBaseClass.  See http://Contensive.io/Docs for details.
	Dot Net code in an Add-on is implemented by uploading the assembly to the application (site), creating an Add-on record, and adding the code's class name to the Add-on's record. 
	The class must expose the method 'Execute' and that method must take one argument of type CPBaseClass, and return an Object.
	If the Add-on is an RPC Remote Method and the method returns a string, the Remote Method will return the string in response to an HTTP request.
	When the addon is called the system passes an object as the CP argument derived from CPBaseClass. 
	The CP object includes properties, methods, and objects that can be used in the application. 
	For example, cp.file.read( filename ) reads the content from a text file from a repository configured in the application, which could be the local file system, Amazon S3 bucket, etc.
